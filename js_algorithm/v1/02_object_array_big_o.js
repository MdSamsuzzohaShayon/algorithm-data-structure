/*
 * An object is a collection of key value pairs
 * To insert O(1), access O(1), and remove O(1) a property the time complexity will be constant
 * No matter how many properties exist in a object it take same amount of time to insert of remove a property
 * To search for a value in a object the time complexity is linear
 * Object.keys() - O(n) Returns an array of all the keys
 * Object.values() - O(n) Returns an array of all the values
 * Object.entries() - O(n) Returns an array of all the key and value

/*
 * Arrays are ordered - we start at index 0 and increment by 1
 * If we insert of remove an element from the end of the array the time complexity is constant O(1)
 * If we insert of remove an element from the beginning of the array the time complexity is linear O(n) because the index has to be reset for every remaining element
 * O(1) - Accessing an element is constant time complexity as fetching the first element is not different from fetching a element at position of 10000
 * O(n) - Searching for an element is still linear time complexity as the element can be the last one in the array
 * O(1) - Push and pop are constant
 * O(n) - Shift, unshift, concat, slice, splice are linear
 * For each map filter, or reduce are also linear
