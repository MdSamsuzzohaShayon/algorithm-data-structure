    Initial Allocation: When a dynamic array is first created, it allocates an initial block of memory. The size of this block is often a small number of elements (e.g., 4 or 8). 

    Insertion: When an element is inserted and there is still available capacity within the allocated block, the element is simply placed into the next available slot. This operation is very fast, 
    typically O(1) time complexity.When a dynamic array is first created, it allocates an initial block of memory. The size of this block is often a small number of elements (e.g., 4 or 8).
    
    Hereâ€™s a step-by-step example of inserting elements into a dynamic array:
    Initial Allocation: A dynamic array starts with an initial capacity of 4. It is currently empty.
        Array: [] (capacity: 4)
    Insertions: Insert elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.
        After inserting 1: [1]
        After inserting 2: [1, 2]
        After inserting 3: [1, 2, 3]
        After inserting 4: [1, 2, 3, 4] (Array is now full)
    Insertion with Resizing: Insert element 5. Since the array is full, it needs to resize.
        Allocate a new array with double the capacity (capacity: 8).
        Copy elements from the old array to the new array: [1, 2, 3, 4, _, _, _, _]
        Insert element 5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, _, _, _]
