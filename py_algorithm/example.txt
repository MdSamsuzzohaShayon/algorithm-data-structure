Hi There,

I'm writing to express my keen interest in developing your Moodle API integration. 
I can Create a PHP single-page checkout form to collect parent and student details and process payments using Stripe Elements. 
After selecting a course, users fill out the form and complete payment. Implement a Stripe webhook to handle payment confirmation, 
create Moodle user accounts, and enroll the student in the selected course. Redirect users to a holding page and display 
a confirmation message once the process is complete.
With my expertise in web development and a solid grasp of 3rd-party API integration,

Before we proceed, I'd like to address a few key points:
          1.  Technology Stack: Would you be open to using either Python Core PHP, Django or Node.js for the development?
          2.  Timeline: What is your expected timeline for project completion?
          3.  Availability: How many hours per week do you anticipate I'll need to dedicate to this project?

Rest assured, I am proficient in English and am comfortable communicating via video calls or text messages to ensure smooth collaboration throughout the project.
I'm eager to discuss your requirements in more detail and explore how I can contribute to the success of your project.
Would it be possible to schedule a call to delve into specifics?

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,
Md Samsuzzoha
