Questions
Basic:
    What is the Fibonacci sequence?
    Answer: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It usually starts with 0 and 1. So, the sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.
    How do you generate the nth Fibonacci number iteratively?
    How do you generate the first n Fibonacci numbers using a loop?

Intermediate:

    How do you generate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion?
    Answer: n-th Fibonacci number using recursion, you define the Fibonacci sequence with two base cases and a recursive case: Base Case F(0)=0 and ùêπ(1)=1. Recursive Case F(n)=F(n‚àí1)+F(n‚àí2)

    What are the time and space complexities of the recursive approach to generating Fibonacci numbers?
    Answer: Time Complexity: ùëÇ(2^ùëõ) The recursive approach has exponential time complexity because it makes multiple recursive calls for each Fibonacci number. Each call generates two more calls,
    leading to a binary tree of calls with an exponential number of nodes. Space Complexity: ùëÇ(ùëõ) The space complexity is ùëÇ(ùëõ) due to the call stack. In the worst case, the depth of the recursive
    call stack can be as large as ùëõ, where n is the input number.

    How can you use memoization to optimize the recursive Fibonacci function?
    Answer: Memoization can significantly optimize a recursive Fibonacci function by storing the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers, thereby avoiding redundant calculations.
    Create a Cache: Use a data structure (like a dictionary) to store the results of Fibonacci calculations. Check the Cache: Before performing a calculation, check if the result is already in the
    cache. Store the Result: After calculating the result, store it in the cache for future use.

Advanced:
    How do you generate the nth Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation?
    
    Answer: The time complexity of generating the n-th Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation is O(log n)
    What is the time complexity of generating the nth Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation?
    
    How can you generate Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming?
    Answer: Generating Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming involves storing previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations, which significantly improves efficiency. 
    The dynamic programming approach can be implemented in two main ways: tabulation (bottom-up approach) and memoization (top-down approach). Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach) This method builds the 
    solution iteratively from the base cases up to the desired n-th Fibonacci number.
