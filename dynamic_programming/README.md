### ChatGPT question
    
    Request:
    I have a dynamic programming problem and its solution. I need an explanation of how tabulation is used in the code. Please provide the explanation as comments within the code, and also include a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity. Here is the problem and the code:

    Problem:
    Write a function bestSum(targetSum, numbers) that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers. The function should return an array containing the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum. If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.

    Code:

    ```
    ```

    Additional Note:
    Please provide a detailed explanation of the time and space complexity for this solution as well.
    Please provide a detailed explanation about how tabulation has been implemented in this program.
