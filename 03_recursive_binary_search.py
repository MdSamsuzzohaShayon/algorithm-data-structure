A recursive function is one that calls itself
Recursive function must need a terminating condition
Iterative solution - the solution implement using loop structure
Recursive solution - A set of stopping condition and a function that it calls itself
Python as a maximum recursion depth afterward it will halt, however, python prefer iterative solution
