 * It is possible to implement a data structures in a few different ways
 * Do not memorize the implementation instant try understanding
 * 
 * What is data structure?
 * A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently
 * A data structure is a loccection of data values the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.
 * 
 * Why we should learn data structures?
 * Almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way to efficiently manage that data, you need to structures. The difference 
 * between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds or even minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure. 
 * Data structures help us to solve problems in more efficient way, both in terms of time and space. learning abouot data structures also 
 * help you gain a more profound understanding of things you are already aware of, such as:
 *      DOM - Tree data structure
 *      Browser back end forward - stack data structure
 *      Operating System job scheduling - Queue data structure
 *    
 * Built in data structures:
 *      1. Arrays  
 *      2. Objects  
 *      3. Sets  
 *      4. Maps  
 * 
 * Custom data structures:
 *      1. Stacks
 *      2. Queues
 *      3. Circular queues
 *      4. Linked lists
 *      5. Hash tables
 *      6. Trees
 *      7. Graphs
