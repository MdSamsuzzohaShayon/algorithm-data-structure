I am going to give you a few topics of Data Structure and Algorithms, you need to create a few questions and more than 2 tasks(basic, intermediate, advanced) for each topic. Moreover, give me some real-life examples (Python code examples with a little bit of explanation) about that as well

 * The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First out (FIFO)
 * First element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed
 * A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the queue from the other end( front/head )
 * Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.
 * 
 * The queue data structure dsupports two main operations
 * Enqueue - Add an element to the rear/tail of the collection
 * Dequeue - Remove an element from the front/head of the collection
 * 
 * Queue usage
 * Printers - printing multiple documents
 * CPU - task scheduling
 * Callback queue in JavaScript runtime

Make this more readable, detailed, organized, and easy to understand the stack data structure in JS. 
Add a few real-life examples. Use cases in real life or real applications.
