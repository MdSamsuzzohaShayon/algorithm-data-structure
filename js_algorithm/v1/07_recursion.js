/*
 * Recursion
 * ========================================================================================================================
 * Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solution to smaller instances of the same problem
 * Or in another terms, recursion is when a function calles itself
 * It is a great technique to simplify your solution
 * If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versiions of the same problem, recursion is very useful
 * Every revursive solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion
 * Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an interative solution
 * Recursion is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand. do not give up if you struggle witht he concept
